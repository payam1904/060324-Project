            <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language
                used for describing the look and
                formatting of a document written in a markup language. It is used to style web pages written in HTML
                and
                XHTML, but can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time,
            Lie
            was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed
            around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium
            resulted
            in the first W3C CSS Recommendation, a "testbed" draft, in 1996. Lie designed the syntax of CSS,
            influenced
            by the existing syntax for Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which is the parent language of
            HTML.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The first CSS specification was developed by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos.
            Håkon
            Wium Lie was also the first person to implement CSS, and with Bert Bos, he proposed the first version of
            CSS
            in 1994. Lie and Bos were the co-authors of the original CSS specification, and working together with
            the
            W3C, they also introduced the first version of the CSS Recommendation in 1996.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from
            document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
            improve
            content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
            characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
            separate
            .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same
            markup
            page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
            speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display the
            web
            page differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed. Users can also
            specify
            a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author
            specified.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">CSS specifies a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more
            than
            one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities or weights are
            calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
            (W3C).
            Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The
            W3C
            operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including
            XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
